      "The TF17 is the newest voice in the Alchemy Series and the latest offering of Telefunken’s vintage-inspired phantom-powered condenser microphones. Combining an iconic mid-forward “German” voicing with modern FET technology, the TF17 is sonically bold with a punchy transient response, high SPL handling, and very low self-noise. Its extended low frequency response, strong midrange, and a smooth top end benefit sources including voice, drums, electric guitar, and piano. Designed with all recording environments in mind, the fixed true cardioid TF17 is perfect for home, studio, or stage. The TF17 features a K47-style center-terminated capsule, premium through-hole components and a UK-made OEP/Carnhill transformer with a high-grade nickel-iron core.",

It possesses the same condenser-like response, minimal proximity effect, and superior feedback rejection one expects from a TELEFUNKEN Dynamic Series microphone. A smooth frequency response, clarity, and wealth of body make the M81 an ideal tool for taming brighter vocals, guitar tones, and fattening up toms, horns, or other thinner sounding sources. Built around a low-mass diaphragm designed to reduce proximity effect, and a custom-wound impedance matching transformer, the M81 features intelligent design and American-assembled construction, making it is an excellent first choice dynamic for most situations.The M81 is available in a variety of colors and finishes through our Custom Shop, and in Low-Profile (M81-SH) and Wireless (M81-WH, M81-WH2) packages.",

      "The M82 is a robust, end-address microphone that features a large dynamic diaphragm with superb low frequency capabilities. Though it was designed to capture fat and punchy kick drum tones, the two on-board EQ switches make the M82 equally suited for a multitude of sources including vocals, percussion, guitar and bass amplifiers, organ, and brass instruments. Both the KICK EQ and HIGH BOOST switches function independently and give the user the ability to tailor the microphone’s response to the source with ease. The M82 is hand-assembled and tested in our American facility.",
